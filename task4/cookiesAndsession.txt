*-------------------COOKIES---------------------------*

Cookies are client-side files that contain user information

Cookie ends depending on the lifetime you set for it

You don't need to start cookie as it is stored in your local machine

 maximum cookie size is 4KB


A cookie is not dependent on Session

There is no function named unsetcookie()

Cookie expires depending on the lifetime you set for it.


*-------------------SESSION---------------------------*

Sessions are server-side files which contain user information

A session ends when a user closes his browser

In PHP, before using $_SESSION, you have to write session_start(); Likewise for other languages

 maximum SESSION SIZE is the memory a script can consume at one time, which is 128MB by default

A session is dependent on Cookie


Session_destroy(); is used to destroy all registered data or to unset some

Session ends when a user closes his/her browser.
